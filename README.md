# DigitDetector
A neural network that can detect the digit drawn in a 32x32 pixel image

This project was originally created in 2019, so some code may be a little out of date. The neural network trains on the examples in Training Data and checks itself against the examples in Test Data. 

The factors can be play ed with to achieve best possible output but currently the highest working accuracy I have been able to achieve was 92.3%. 

To run the network against a custom image, enter a 32x32 pixel .png file into the Field folder. Name it Untitled.png and replace the current image. Then run just the last section of code and it will output its guess. 

This project was originally created for HackMCST 2019 by myself, Aman Sheth.
